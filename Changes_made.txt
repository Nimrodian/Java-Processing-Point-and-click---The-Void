CHANGES MADE SINCE FORMATIVE SUBMISSION.
----------------------------------------
My Original game that I submitted for the formative submission was not very advanced
and the only challenging bit of programming I had done by then was the converging of 
enemies to the soldier/player in the middle. So now that it is complete I have made 
a lot of changes since then;

. An Enemy can now be removed when clicked on. It looks like a bullet is fired but there
is not an actual bullet or a bullet class. It is just removed when clicked on, to make it 
appear like it is being shot at.

. The enemies now increase speed as the game goes on, essentially giving the game
a level system, as the difficulty is gradually increasing.

. The Player/soldier now has a health and score bar, where the health bar is decremented
when an enemy spaceship reaches it (after not being destroyed in time). And where the score
is incremented when the player successfully destroys an enemy spaceship.

. The Player can now "die" after all of its health reaches zero.

. Multiple splash screens are now in place;
	
	. Start game splash screen, giving the user options to either start the game or 
	  view the rules.
	. A "Rules/How to play" splash screen, accessable by the main start screen.
	. A pause screen that will stop the game running until the user unpauses.
	. A "Game Over" splash screen that will be displayed when the players health 
	  has reached zero.

. The enemies now have an animated sequence when they are moving, changing the colour of 
  the lights on the spaceship every second.

. The enemies now have a death Image/animated sequence that will be display an explosion 
  when they are destroyed.

. The user has the option to restart the game once it is over by pressing a key.

. The user has the option to quit the game once it is over by pressing a key.
